# About
This is a personal project built in Vanilla JavaScript. Form validation is the process where the web-form checks if the information provided by a user is correct. The form will either alert the user that they have done a mistake that needs to be fixed in order to proceed, or the form will be validated and the user will be able to continue with their registration process.
